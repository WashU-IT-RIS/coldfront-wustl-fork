if num_walkers is 2, parallelized walk will start at level 1 with:
    /storage2/fs1/japrewitt/Active/A
    /storage2/fs1/japrewitt/Active/B
    /storage2/fs1/japrewitt/Active/C
then a walk to depth 1 will happen, covering:
    /storage2/fs1/japrewitt
    /storage2/fs1/japrewitt/README
    /storage2/fs1/japrewitt/Active
    # NOTE: this repeat is deliberate as a precaution against fencepost errors

    /storage2/fs1/japrewitt/Active/B/B
